# Near-Real-Time-Data-Warehouse-for-METRO
# Project Overview
This project involves designing, implementing, and analyzing a near-real-time Data Warehouse (DW) prototype for METRO Shopping Store in Pakistan. The goal is to enable efficient analysis of customer shopping behavior by integrating and enriching transactional data in near-real-time using the MESHJOIN algorithm.

# Key Features
  - Star Schema Design: Created a star schema to model multidimensional data for effective analysis.
  - MESHJOIN Algorithm Implementation: Developed an extended version of the MESHJOIN algorithm using Java in Eclipse, enabling near-real-time enrichment and integration of transactional data with master data.
  - ETL Process: Built an end-to-end ETL pipeline for extracting, transforming, and loading data into the DW.
  - OLAP Queries: Performed advanced analytics using slicing, dicing, drill-downs, and materialized views to answer business-critical questions such as:
       -- Top revenue-generating products by time and season.
       -- Store and supplier revenue trends and volatility.
       -- Product affinity analysis for bundling strategies.
    
# Technologies Used
  - Java (Eclipse): For implementing the ETL process and MESHJOIN algorithm.
  - SQL: For designing the star schema and performing OLAP queries.
  - Database Management: Created a relational database to store the DW.
    
# Analysis Highlights
  - Seasonal and trend analysis of product sales.
  - Revenue volatility by store and supplier.
  - Product bundling recommendations based on affinity analysis.
    
# Deliverables
  - SQL script for creating and populating the star schema.
  - Java implementation of the MESHJOIN algorithm.
  - Comprehensive OLAP queries for business insights.
  - Detailed project report documenting the process and findings.
